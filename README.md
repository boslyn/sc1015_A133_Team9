# SC1015 Data Science Mini Project - Fake News 
## About
In the age of digitalisation, the rise of fake news has been at an unprecendented rate, inflicting harm on the society. 
Our mini project aims to apply what we have learnt in the course to come up with a model to classify if a news article is fake or real.
