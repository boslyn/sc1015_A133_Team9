# SC1015 Data Science Mini Project - Fake News 
## About
In the age of digitalisation, the rise of fake news has been at an unprecendented rate, inflicting harm on the society. 
Our mini project aims to apply what we have learnt in the course to come up with a model to classify if a news article is fake or real.

## Flow of SC1015_Project.ipynb
Our Jupyter notebook has been organised in the following manner:
1. Introduction & Problem statement
2. Data Preparation & Cleaning
3. Data Exploration
4. Machine Learning (Models)

## Problem Statement
How might we determine if news on online platform is real or fake?
Which model would be the most suitable in helping us classify if a news article is real or fake?

## Models Explored
1. Logistic Regression Model
2. Naive-Bayes Prediction Model
3. Decision Tree Classifier Model
4. Passive-Aggressive Classifier Model
5. Support Vector Machine Classifier Model
6. Ensemble
